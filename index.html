					<h4>Pokemon Search Engine</h4>
					<p>
						A simple search engine application for searching Pokemon. The user
						can search any pokemon they want and will return the desired result.
						This application uses a public API called PokeAPI. This is my first
						project I created utilizing everything I learned in JavaScript.
						Utilizing classes, a model, controller and view paradigm

						This is a clone of the official site of WWE (World Wrestling

						browser and mobile/tablet users. It isn't the best solution but it

					<h4>Genshin Countdown & Randomizer Minigame</h4>
					<p>
						This is a combination of two small projects I did when learning
						JavaScript. First one was a Randomizer minigame where you click a
						button and you get a random character. It was the first mini project
						I ever made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The second one is a
						countdown leading to when the game's version goes into maintenance.
						Once the initial countdown timer ends. The second timer which is the
						maintenance will automatically begin. I learned to use countdowns
						and timers for this project. This is my beginner learning roots
						project.

								I got to be a part of an event called AWS GameDay. The event was
								hosted by Amazon in one of their buildings in Manhattan. The
								building is called Amazon JFK 14 and it was so much fun. I got
								the opportunity to work with other students and work together on
								solving problems on a website utilizing the AWS services. The
								services we were able to use was AWS EC2, VPC, S3, WAF, and RDS.
								I knew what they were but never really used them before. I was
								only familiar with EC2 because I did use it before. It was a
								friendly competition among the groups. I honestly had so much
								fun interacting and talking with the students and staff there. I
								learned so much from them. It made me realize working with
								others and learning from them and talking about our passions is
								truly the happiest feeling for me. I want to experience life and
								work like that everyday. I was filled with excitement and filled
								with curiousity on wanting to keep learning and learning from
								people. I kept nonstop talking about code and explaining my
								process on how I was able to understand JavaScript. Learning is
								so much fun to me. I don't regret going to this event one bit.
								It was truly the best decision I ever made. I'm glad I recieved
								an invitation.

								This day is when I started to learn React. I'm more confident
								with my knowledge in JavaScript. I know the projects I have
								created aren't professional yet. But that's what I'm working on
								now while learning React. Transitioning and adapting to React
								was really easy coming in with JavaScript knowledge. I realized
								why React is called React! I was blown away at first but it
								isn't so difficult. I started to use React as class components
								because I was familiar with it and used it in JavaScript. Now
								I'm using React as functional components. Learning about React
								Hooks and React Router. I just wanna play around with it more.
								I'm eager and excited to learn more and build real world
								professional applications in React. My current projects are
								still meaningful to me because those were my learning roots. I
								learned so much doing those projects. I want to level up from
								small projects to real world projects next as my main goal. Of
								course learning React isn't the end goal. I want to learn other
								technologies such as Back-End and Databases. There's so much to
								learn and I'm eager to learn it.

							<h2>February 2018</h2>
							<p>
								This month, I was selected for my class to represent Information
								Technology and the school to take part in the New York City
								SKILLS USA Competition. The school I attended was the School of
								Cooperative Technical Education. I loved that school. I was
								going there while going through my first year of college at the
								same time. It was hard but I managed my time and was able to
								achieve my goals. I learned a lot about Information Technology.
								Building computers, troubleshooting, setting up new hardware,
								documentating/fixing hardware and software issues. The SKILLS
								USA Competition gave me the opportunity to not only compete but
								learn and interact with others. I had fun learning from my peers
								there. I felt alot of pressure since it was the first time I
								ever competed against other students. The tasks during the
								competition was first build a computer and successfully get it
								to the BIOS setup. The second task is to assemble a functional
								Ethernet cable. Test it using a Network Cable Tester to make
								sure it works. The final task was to troubleshoot some software
								issues and change minor details for the user on a desktop. I
								came in 2nd Place. I was still really proud of myself to have
								come in 2nd place. I never thought I would be a part of
								something that important and huge in the first place. I was
								happy and had a ton of fun. I wasn't expecting to recieve a
								medal but did and I will always remember the time I not only
								felt pressure but still practiced and worked hard to have come
								in 2nd Place.
